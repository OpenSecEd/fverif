As soon as two principals need to interact, there is need for a protocol --- be 
it inside or between systems, even one principal communicating with itself in 
different points in time (which is the case when storing something for use at a 
later time).
These protocols need different properties.
We will explore how to design secure protocols and introduce some tools for 
verifying security properties of protocols.

Anderson gives an overview of this area in 
\citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea}, Chapter 
3 \enquote{Protocols}.
Gollmann has a more technically detailed treatment in Chapter 15 of 
\citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
