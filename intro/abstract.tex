As soon as two principals need to interact, there is need for a protocol which 
secures the communication, be it inside or between systems --- even one 
principal communicating with itself in different points in time, which is the 
case when storing something for use at a later time.
We will explore how to design secure protocols and introduce some tools for 
verification.

Anderson gives an overview of this area in 
\citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea}, Chapter 
3 \enquote{Protocols}.
Gollmann has a more technically detailed treatment in Chapter 15 of 
\citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
