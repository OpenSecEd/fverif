% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.


\section{Secure protocols}

\subsection{What's a protocol?}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{definition}[Protocol]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A system consists of some set of entities.
      \item A protocol is a set of rules governing their communication.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{definition}

  \pause

  \begin{example}[Exam]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The invigilator opens the room and gives each student a number.
      \item The students take their numbered seats.
      \item The invigilator checks each student's ID and number.
      \item The invigilator checks again when student hands in exam.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{remark}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Protocols must be designed to resist attacks.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[Ordering wine]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The Maître d'Hôtel brings the list of wines.
      \item The host chooses wine, the Maître d'Hôtel brings.
      \item The host tastes, then it's served.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{example}

  \pause

  \begin{block}{Properties}
    \begin{description}
      \item[Confidentiality] The guests never learn the price.
      \item[Integrity] The Maître d'Hôtel cannot change wine.
      \item[Non-repudiation] The host cannot falsely complain about the wine 
        \emph{after dinner}.
    \end{description}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Modelling and Assumptions}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{remark}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Protocols are constructed from basic assumptions.
      \item We must analyse if the threats violates assumptions.
      \item Must analyse if the protocol actually mitigates them.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[Exam]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The invigilator opens the room and gives each student a number.
      \item The students take their numbered seats.
      \item The invigilator checks each student's ID and number.
      \item The invigilator checks again when student hands in exam.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{example}

  \pause

  \begin{block}{Properties}
    \begin{description}
      \item[Anonymity] The teacher cannot distinguish two students.
      \item[Authenticity] The student who handed in the exam gets the 
        grade.
    \end{description}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{block}{Properties}
    \begin{description}
      \item[Anonymity] The teacher cannot distinguish two students.
      \item[Authenticity] The student who wrote the exam gets the grade.
    \end{description}
  \end{block}

  \begin{exercise}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Who is the adversary/-ies?
      \item What are the assumptions?
      \item Does the exam protocol achieve these properties?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exercise}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{remark}[Adversaries]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The teacher wants to map student identity to exam.
      \item The student want to hand in someone else's answers.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}

  \begin{question}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What can they do?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{question}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{remark}[Assumptions]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The numbers are randomly assigned.
      \item The students cannot communicate during the exam.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{remark}[Deanonymize exams]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The teacher had the same class in a previous course.
      \item The teacher learned everyone's handwriting.
      \item Handwriting is unique enough to deanonymize exams.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}
\end{frame}

\subsection{More examples}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[Non-anonymous exam]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The invigilator opens the room.
      \item The students take self-chosen seats.
      \item The invigilator checks each student's ID and notes placement.
      \item The student hands the exam to the invigilator.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{example}

  \pause

  \begin{remark}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item No authenticity.
      \item Even with the same assumptions.
      \item Students can write each other's names on the exam.
      \item They don't need to communicate during the exam.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[Authenticate withdrawals]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Banks stored account number on the magnet strip.
      \item The PIN-code was sent to the central system for verification.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}

  \pause

  \begin{example}[Improved for offline ATMs]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Banks stored account number on the magnet strip.
      \item Banks stored the PIN \emph{encrypted} on the magnet strip.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[Remote car locks, 1990s]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The key broadcast the car's serial number.
      \item If in range, the car checked and unlocked.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}

  \pause

  \begin{remark}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Replay attack: record, replay.
      \item Wrongly assumed that only (honest) cars are listening.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[Remote car locks, 2019]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Do secure crypto stuff (challenge--response).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}

  \pause

  \begin{remark}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Relay attack: record in one end, transmit in other.
      \item Wrongly assumed that the key is close if it \enquote{talks} to the 
        car.
      \item Distance-bounding protocols are starting to get implemented.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}
